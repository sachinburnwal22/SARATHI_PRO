### Notes

- All `.jsx` files in the app directory have been converted to `.tsx` for better TypeScript support
- Hardcoded localhost URLs have been replaced with environment variables
- The application is configured for both static and server-side rendering
- Authentication middleware is properly configured for production deployment
- **CRITICAL**: Removed conflicting `loginF` folder that contained a separate Vite React app
- Integrated authentication pages directly into the Next.js app structure
- Removed all authentication requirements - all pages are now accessible without login

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter build issues:
1. Check that all environment variables are set
2. Ensure Node.js version is 18+
3. Clear `.next` folder and rebuild
4. Check Vercel build logs for specific errors
